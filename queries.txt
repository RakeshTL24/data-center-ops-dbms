1.Query to get all servers along with their associated data center details:
SELECT s.server_id, s.Smodel, s.processor_type, s.ram_size, s.storage_capacity, d.name AS datacenter_name, d.location
FROM server s
INNER JOIN data_center d ON s.datacenter_id = d.datacenter_id;


2.Query to calculate the total cost of all maintenance activities:
SELECT SUM(cost) AS total_maintenance_cost
FROM maintenance_activity;

3.Query to get all servers and their associated maintenance activities:
SELECT s.server_id, s.Smodel, m.activity_id, m.technician_name, m.date, m.cost
FROM server s
LEFT JOIN maintenance_activity m ON s.datacenter_id = m.datacenter_id;

4.Query to calculate the percentage of ports utilized for each type of network equipment:
SELECT ne.Equipment_name, ne.type,
       COUNT(c.server_id) / ne.port_count * 100 AS utilization_percentage
FROM network_equipment ne
LEFT JOIN connection c ON ne.Equipment_name = c.Equipment_name
GROUP BY ne.Equipment_name, ne.type, ne.port_count;

5.Query to find the data center(s) with the highest and lowest power usage:
SELECT name AS datacenter_name, power_usage
FROM data_center
WHERE power_usage = (SELECT MAX(power_usage) FROM data_center)
   OR power_usage = (SELECT MIN(power_usage) FROM data_center);



6.Query to find servers with the most recent maintenance activity:
SELECT server_id, Smodel, last_maintenance_date
FROM (
    SELECT s.server_id, s.Smodel, MAX(m.date) AS last_maintenance_date
    FROM server s
    LEFT JOIN maintenance_activity m ON s.datacenter_id = m.datacenter_id
    GROUP BY s.server_id, s.Smodel
) AS recent_maintenance
ORDER BY last_maintenance_date DESC
LIMIT 1;
